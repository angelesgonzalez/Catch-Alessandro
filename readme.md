# 🐾 Catch Alessandro 🎮

## 📋 About the Game

**Catch Alessandro** is a game developed during the CodeOp Front-End bootcamp. The aim is to practice using vanilla JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM.

Alessandro is my dog, whom I’ve playfully turned into a character for this game. The idea was to add a lighthearted, personal touch to the project while practicing my skills in JavaScript.
